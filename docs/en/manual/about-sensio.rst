About Sensio
************

**Sensio Labs** is a French web agency well known for its innovative
ideas on web development. Founded in 1998 by Fabien Potencier, Gregory
Pascal, and Samuel Potencier, Sensio benefited from the Internet growth
of the late 1990s and situated itself as a major player for building
complex web applications. It survived the Internet bubble burst by
applying professional and industrial methods to a business where most
players seemed to reinvent the wheel for each project. Most of Sensio’s
clients are large French corporations, who hire its teams to deal with
small- to middle-scale projects with strong time-to-market and
innovation constraints.

Sensio Labs develops interactive web applications, both for dot-com and
traditional companies. Sensio Labs also provides auditing, consulting,
and training on Internet technologies and complex application
deployment. It helps define the global Internet strategy of large-scale
industrial players. Sensio Labs has projects in France and abroad.

For its own needs, Sensio Labs develops the symfony framework and
sponsors its deployment as an Open-Source project. This means that
symfony is built from experience and is employed in many web
applications, including those of large corporations.

Since its beginnings ten years ago, Sensio has always based its strategy
on strong technical expertise. The company focuses on Open-Source
technologies, and as for dynamic scripting languages, Sensio offers
developments in all LAMP platforms. Sensio acquired strong experience on
the best frameworks using these languages, and often develops web
applications in Django, Rails, and, of course, symfony.

Sensio Labs is always open to new business opportunities, so if you ever
need help developing a web application, learning symfony, or evaluating
a project using Doctrine, feel free to contact us at
fabien.potencier@sensio.com. The consultants, project managers, web
designers, and developers of Sensio can handle projects from A to Z.
